        <p style="font-size: larger;"> The <em>unique</em> and <em>interesting</em> pieces 
            that hop over other pieces, <strong>The Knights!</strong> </p>

        <blockquote style="background-color:antiquewhite;font-size: large;border-left: 4px solid brown">
            <p>
                <em>
                    The Knight is another piece that can be moved upon the start of a chess game,
                    as it is able to move over other pieces! It is an imporatant piece to <strong>develop</strong>
                    at the start of the game as it is able to control pieces that the pawns are not able to reach,
                    therefore allowing for a stronger <strong>grip</strong> and <strong>control</strong> over the center of the
                    board.
                    <br>
                    Although moving the knight at the start of the game is possible, I perfer to move the pawn
                    initially to have more space in the center and then support my center pawns with my knights.
                    These valiant warriors give stability to the game as a whole and give chess a more unique element.
                    Without them the game would revolve only around staright lines and diagonals!
                    </em>

        <p><strong>The Knight</strong> moves in an <em>L shape.</em> From it's starting position, it is able to move to two
        other squares, and it is able to, unlike the pawn, move backward! 
        <blockquote><p><em>But it is perferable to move your knights to the center, and in general don't move
        your pieces backwards unless necessary.</em></p></blockquote>

        <p><strong>The Knight</strong> at its fullest extent is able to control <em>eight</em> squares, and since it can <em>hop</em>
        over pieces, planting it in a spot where it cannot be capured in the enemy territory <strong>(outpost)</strong> can allow you to restrict your
        opponent's position and piece activity.</p>

            <p>Additionally, it pairs really well with the pawn in the center, as shown below:</p>
