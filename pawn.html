         <p style="font-size: larger;"> The first and arguably <em>cornerstone</em> chess piece is the <strong>pawn!</strong></p>

                <em> 
                The pawn is the chess piece that initiates a great majority of games! (unless 
                you claim to be eccentric and move the knight). It is the back bone of your
                structural piece integrity and is what makes or breaks your game!
                <br>
                Initially moving pawns is easy, but what is difficult is utilizing them to 
                create an attack! Many assume pieces are only important, but they are essentially
                useless without the power of these round warriors!

         <p>The pawn from the starting square square is able to move <strong>one</strong> or <strong>two</strong> sqaures,
        but afterwards is only able to move <em>one</em> square.</p>

        <p>The pawn is <em>NOT</em> able to go backwards, but the pawn controls one tile on the forward diagonals.
        <br> A pawn is able to move diagonally only if a piece comes near its controlled squares, in which it captures the piece and moves
        diagonally by one.</p>
