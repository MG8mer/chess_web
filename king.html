                <em>
                    The King is by definition is the soul of chess, without him the pieces would have
                    no power! So therfore if he is captured, the side that captured the king would win. However,
                    the King cannot be captured, that would be what is called an <strong>illegal</strong> move!
                    Instead, the King must be trapped, where he is in a state of almost being captured, but cannot
                    escape anywhere else.
                    <br>
                    On top of this, the King is even more vulnerable as he has a very limited mobility, so it is 
                    up to his fellow pieces to aid him to victory! (or to a draw).
                </em>

        <p>The King as mentioned before has quite a limited mobility, in which he is only able to move one square
        in each way as shown below:</p>

        <p>Unlike the other pieces, the King expectedly is a special piece, in which there are three unique states
       <br>it can be in when he is attacked:</p>

       <ul>
            <li><strong>Check</strong>: When a piece threatens the king, which can be responded to by moving the king away,
                <br> blocking the check, or capturing the piece if possible.
            or taking the piece if possible:</li>

            <img src="web_images/king/check.png" alt="Check" width="400" height="400">
            <p>then,</p>
            <li><strong>Checkmate</strong>: When a piece threatens the king <strong>AND</strong> the King cannot escape as other pieces, 
                are guarding his escape squares, the check cannot be blocked and the piece cannot be captured because it's guarded:</li>

            <img src="web_images/king/checkmate.png" alt="Checkmate" width="400" height="400">

            <p>and finally,</p>

            <li><strong>Stalemate</strong>: When the king is trapped <strong>BUT</strong> is not being threatened <strong>AND</strong>
            there are no other possible moves:</li>
        </ul>
