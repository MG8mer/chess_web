                    The Rook is another piece that stands behind the pawns and must be uncovered
                    to be <strong>"activated".</strong> However, it's development comes later on
                    towards the middlegame stage, as the developmet of the knights/bishops comes
                    first due to their easy accesibility, but it takes some time for one of the Rooks
                    to have an open line of attack and gain some activity.
                    <br> 
                    Nontheless, the Rook is indeed a very powerful piece that can shift the dimensions of
                    a board merely through their activity potential. Although the Bishop and Rook are similar
                    in how the control a certain <strong>"plane"</strong> of the board, the Rook is considered
                    to be worth more and have more attacking potential, as the the two Rooks together can be coordinated
                    together to create potent pressure and an attack, but it is quite hard to coordinate the two Rooks. One
                    Rook is quite strong and can do damage, but not the same as two coordinated Rooks.

        <p>The Rook is able to move in <em>any</em> kind of straight line, which makes it
        inherently more powerful than the Bishop as it controls <strong>dark</strong> and <strong>light</strong> squares!</p>

        <p>!</p>
        <p>Because of the nature of the Rook's movement, it is difficult to develop early on, and 
        therfore should be utilized in the middlegame, typically when <em>files</em> open for the Rook to gain control
        over and cause problems for the opponent.</p>

        <p>Despite this, as mentioned before, Rooks become <em>quite</em> potent when they are properly coordinated,
        and this harmony can be achieved in a number of different ways, but the methods I will showcase are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Doubling the Rooks on the same file, putting pressure on a certain area of the board or on a piece (or both!)</li>
            <li>Connecting the Rooks on the same rank, allowing them to provide mutual defense to one another and creating a <strong>lazer
            beam</strong> on that rank.</li>
        </ul>
