            <p>
                <em>
                    Unlike the Pawn and Knights, the Bishop cannot be moved immediatly at the start of a chess game, but rather a Pawn must
                    move to <strong>uncover</strong> its diagonal so that it can be developed. Nontheless, the Bishop is another piece that 
                    should be developed as quick as possible to the center board in order to gain space and control more squares.
                    <br> 
                    Alongside the knights and pawns, the bishops are able to create a large and stable center where most of the squares
                    are controlled, forcing the opponent to utilize <strong>pawn breaks</strong> in the center or pawns on the king/queenside <strong>
                    (flank pawns)</strong>.
                </em>
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Standard development with the pieces we have covered thus far typically goes as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pawns to the center <em>(e4/d5, both if possible)</em></li>
            <li>Knights out <em>(Nf3/Nc3, preferably both)</em></li>
            <li>Light/Dark squared bishops out <em>(typically in the center, but to other squares if possible) </em></li>
            <li>Castle, in which you move the king two/three squares (O-O/O-O-O) towards one of the rooks, and the rook also moves that same amount in the opposite
            direction, in this case towards the king's side.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With just these pieces, if you do everything right and there are no interferences from your opponent, you will have an advantageous
        center looking like this:</p>

        <p>The bishop moves only in diagonals, and the reason why developing to the center is importnat as 
            <br>that allows it to see more squares, which can include ones in the enemy territory.</p>

        <p>However, because of the <em>tiled</em> nature of the chess board,
        both bishops are different: 
        <br> <em>One controls the light squares, the controls the dark ones, as shown below:</em></p>
